## Methods

### 3.1 Data Collection and Preparation

- Collect the LinkedIn job postings dataset from Kaggle.
- Clean and prepare the data by removing duplicate entries, correcting typos, and handling missing values.

### 3.2 Feature Engineering

- Create new features to enhance the machine learning model's performance.
- Example: Combine candidate education and experience into a single "experience" feature.

### 3.3 Model Selection and Training

- Train a Random Forest model to predict the likelihood of a candidate being hired.
- Random Forest is chosen for its accuracy and ability to handle complex data.

### 3.4 Model Evaluation and Interpretation

- Evaluate the model's performance on a held-out test set.
- Interpret the model's predictions to identify the most crucial elements influencing hiring decisions.
